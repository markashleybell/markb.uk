# Hi, I'm Mark. I build web sites, apps and development tools at [Webselect](https://www.webselect.net/ "External Link: Webselect").

I write code in C#, F#, JavaScript and Python,
and [sometimes I write about programming](/articles.html). I also maintain several [open source projects](https://github.com/markashleybell "External Link: GitHub Profile").
